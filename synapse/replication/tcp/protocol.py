"""This module contains the implementation of both the client and server
protocols.

The basic structure of the protocol is line based, where the initial word of
each line specifies the command. The rest of the line is parsed based on the
command. For example, the `RDATA` command is defined as::

    RDATA <stream_name> <token> <row_json>

(Note that `<row_json>` may contains spaces, but cannot contain newlines.)

Blank lines are ignored.


# Keep alives

Both sides are expected to send at least one command every 5s (`PING_TIME`), and
should send a `PING` command if necessary. If either side do not receive a
command within e.g. 15s then the connection should be closed.

Because the server may be connected to manually using e.g. netcat, the timeouts
aren't enabled until an initial `PING` command is seen. Both the client and
server implementations below send a `PING` command immediately on connection to
ensure the timeouts are enabled.

This ensures that both sides can quickly realize if the tcp connection has gone
and handle the situation appropriately.


# Start up

When a new connection is made, the server:
 * Sends a `SERVER` command, which includes the identity of the server, allowing
   the client to detect if its connected to the expected server
 * Sends a `PING` command as above, to enable the client to time out connections
   promptly.

The client:
 * Sends a `NAME` command, allowing the server to associate a human friendly
   name with the connection. This is optional.
 * Sends a `PING` as above
 * For each stream the client wishes to subscribe to it sends a `REPLICATE`
   with the stream_name and token it wants to subscribe from.
 * On receipt of a `SERVER` command, checks that the server name matches the
   expected server name.


# Error handling

If either side detects an error it can send an `ERROR` command and close the
connection.

If the client side loses the connection to the server it should reconnect,
following the steps above.


# Reliability

In general the replication stream should be consisdered an unreliable transport
since e.g. commands are not resent if the connection disappears.

The exception to that are the replication streams, i.e. RDATA commands, since
theses include tokens which can be used to restart the stream on connection
errors.

The client should keep track of the token in the last RDATA command received
for each stream so that on reconneciton it can start streaming from the correct
place. Note: not all RDATA have valid tokens due to batching. See
`commands.RdataCommand` for more details.


# Example

An example iteraction is shown below. Each line is prefixed with '>' or '<' to
indicate which side is sending, these are *not* included on the wire::

    * connection established *
    > SERVER localhost:8823
    > PING 1490197665618
    < NAME synapse.app.appservice
    < PING 1490197665618
    < REPLICATE events 1
    < REPLICATE backfill 1
    < REPLICATE caches 1
    > POSITION events 1
    > POSITION backfill 1
    > POSITION caches 1
    > RDATA caches 2 ["get_user_by_id",["@01register-user:localhost:8823"],1490197670513]
    > RDATA events 14 ["$149019767112vOHxz:localhost:8823",
    "!AFDCvgApUmpdfVjIXm:localhost:8823","m.room.guest_access","",null]
    < PING 1490197675618
    > ERROR server stopping
    * connection closed by server *

The `POSITION` command sent by the server is used to set the clients position
without needing to send data with the `RDATA` command.
